# fake_news_detection_plateform
a Flask vueJS web application to detect fake news automatically.

This application consists of my Bachelor graduation project.In this project, we are interested in proposing a solution to identify fake news in the media using a hybrid approach that combines linguistic and machine learning approaches with the possibility of using other resources and types of information such as semantic information.


A prototype of a hybrid fake news detection system will be implemented and evaluated.



This app was delivered along with a research dissertation that contains the entirety of the research, conception and implementation work that was done over the three-months period that this project lasted.
